# GeoLite2-City Database via jsDelivr CDN

The GeoLite2-City database, provided by [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/), is used for accurate geo-location information. It is an essential component of [WP Statistics](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-statistics/), a popular privacy-focused analytics solution for WordPress, enabling detailed insights into visitor locations.

### Database Maintenance & Update Schedule
Since this database is integrated with the WP Statistics plugin, **we currently update the database twice per month** to maintain the accuracy and reliability of the geo-location data.

After realizing its potential utility for other developers and projects, we decided to make the database easily accessible via GitHub and the jsDelivr CDN.
